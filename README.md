# Rdoc - Your Central Documentation Hub

Welcome to Rdoc, a documentation library designed to bring all your essential documentation into one easily accessible place.

## About Rdoc

Rdoc aims to simplify the process of finding and using documentation for various projects, libraries, and APIs.  Instead of scattered PDFs, online websites, and code comments, Rdoc provides a unified interface for all your documentation needs.

## Key Features (In Development)

*   **Centralized Documentation:**  Store and access documentation from various sources in one location.
*   **Easy Navigation:**  Quickly find the information you need with intuitive search and filtering.
*   **AI Integration (Future):**  Enable AI agents to seamlessly access and utilize documentation through a Minecraft server interface.
*   **MCP Server Access (Future):**  Integrate with Minecraft Protocol (MCP) servers to allow AI and other applications to programmatically access documentation.

## Current Status

Rdoc is currently in early development.  Expect rapid changes and improvements as we work towards a stable release.

## Future Roadmap

*   Enhanced search capabilities
*   Support for more documentation formats
*   Implementation of AI integration features
*   MCP server integration
